## Argument-Keypoint Mapping for Automatic Argument Summarization

In this document, we walk through running our experiments on the Argument-to-keypoints task.

### Data
In this project we use the ArgKP dataset for Argument-to-keypoint summarization task. 
There are different sets of data in the Data folder

### Pre-processing

### Baseline

### Approach 1
Approach1_T5_base_OpenPrompt.ipynb contains all the codes for different experiments of the approach 1. 

This notebook contains five different templates that four of them are commented out and only one of them should be used in each experiment.

To reproduce the results of **zero-shot** experiments, the **Training** step must be skipped. 

To reproduce the results of **few-shot** experiments, the **few-shot train set** should be imported. 

To reproduce the results of different **subset** experiments, the **subset train set** should be imported.
### Approach 2
